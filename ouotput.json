        "link": "https://laion.ai/blog/datacomp/",
        "summary": " LAION announced a new benchmark called DataComp to encourage studying design decisions for data sets. DataComp features CommonPool, the largest collection of image-text pairs to date with 12.8B samples and DataComp-1B, a 1.4B subset that can be used to outperform compute-matched CLIP models from OpenAI and LAION. DataComp is designed to accommodate participants with various levels of resources and features pre-determined training procedure, compute requirements, and evaluation suite. It invites participants to innovate by proposing new training sets, leaving the training code, hyper-parameters and compute fixed."

        "date": "15 Apr, 2023",
        "link": "https://laion.ai/blog/paella/",
        "summary": "Paella is a new text-to-image model that encodes images into a quantized latent space and is optimized with a CrossEntropy loss. The model's training and sampling code is minimalistic and can be understood and implemented in a few lines of code. It draws inspiration from existing approaches such as MaskGIT and eliminates the need for hyperparameters usually required by other models. Paella has the potential to advance the state of the art in text-to-image synthesis and make it more accessible and comprehensible to a broader audience."

        "date": "29 Mar, 2023",
        "link": "https://laion.ai/blog/petition/",
        "summary": "LAION is calling for the establishment of an international, open-source supercomputing research facility, similar to CERN, to democratize AI research and access. This will ensure societal betterment and technological independence while protecting democratic principles. Additionally, the facility should feature AI Safety research labs to quickly identify and address potential risks. Signing the petition is a way to join the campaign to ensure AI technologies are accessible to everyone in a responsible way. Together we can build a brighter future through advanced AI technologies."
