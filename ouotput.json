        "summary": "LAION has released a billion-scale open-source image-text dataset, LAION-5B, which has become a staple in the open-source machine learning ecosystem. DataComp is a new benchmark for designing multimodal datasets, featuring CommonPool, the largest public collection of image-text pairs to date with 12.8B samples. DataComp-1B, a 1.4B subset of CommonPool, can be used to train a CLIP ViT-L model to 79.2% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet, outperforming OpenAI's model trained with the same compute. DataComp encourages participants to innovate by proposing new training sets, leaving the training code, hyper-parameters and compute fixed.",

        "date": "15 Apr, 2023",
        "link": "https://laion.ai/blog/paella/",
        "summary": "LAION has released a new text-to-image model called Paella which works in a quantized latent space and is simpler to understand than other state-of-the-art models. Paella is trained with a CrossEntropy loss and sampled with a 12 line code. It is conditioned on CLIP image embeddings and has been trained on the Laion-A dataset. Paella is still a work in progress, but has the potential to contribute useful insights and advance the state of the art in text-to-image synthesis.",
        "answer": "LAION has released a new text-to-image model called Paella which is designed to be simple and efficient, and is accessible to a broader audience."

        "link": "https://laion.ai/blog/petition/",
        "summary": "This petition calls for the establishment of an international, publicly funded, open-source supercomputing research facility to democratize access to AI technology and ensure its safety. It proposes the creation of AI Safety research labs to identify and address potential risks, and suggests that this will benefit small and medium-sized companies. Finally, it encourages people to join the campaign and make their voices heard in order to build a future where AI technology is accessible to all.",
