        "summary": "The Russian-Ukrainian conflict has caused devastation and displacement on both sides of the border, with civilians in Shebekino, Russia, being the latest victims. Russian propaganda has twisted the conflict into a defensive war against the West, but the shelling of residential areas has caused some Russians to feel the pain of the war. Despite the mounting attacks, Russian resolve to win the war is still strong, and the government has done little to address the situation. The conflict has caused a great deal of suffering and confusion for those affected, with no end in sight.",
        "answer": "This article is about the effects of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict on the Russian border town of Shebekino, where shelling from Ukraine has caused the displacement of thousands of people and destruction of property.",
